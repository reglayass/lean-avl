In this section, we verify the operations presented above. Each subsction details the proof statements for specific operations and informally explains how to complete the proofs. The process begins with verifying correctness of the operations that do not make changes to the tree, like lookup and search, and then moves on to AVL tree rotations, finishing with insertion and deletion. For the latter two subsections, the proofs involve key and order preservation, and restoration of balance. 

This section does not detail all of the proof constructions, but does give all the necessary lemmas and proofs are details when it is either important to understand the proof statement or when the proof construction led to core design decisions. Any auxiliary lemmas that were created during the process are outlined as well. The lemma statements presented closely follow \cite{textbook:discrete_computer}, though some changes were made to statements to suit the Lean definitions.
