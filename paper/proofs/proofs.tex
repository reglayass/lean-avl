In this section, we verify the operations presented above. Each subsection details examples of proof statements for specific operations and informally explains how to complete the proofs. AVL tree operations need to restore balance, as well as preserve order and keys. This section does not detail all of the proof constructions, but goes give all the necessary lemmas and proofs are detailed when it is either important to understand the proof statement or when the proof construction led to core design decisions. The lemma statements presented here closely follow \cite{textbook:discrete_computer}, though some changes were made to statements to suit the Lean definitions.
