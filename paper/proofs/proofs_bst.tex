First, we prove two lemmas related to boundedness and lookup in a tree, since \lstinline{lookup} and \lstinline{bound} are identical for both BSTs and AVL trees.

\begin{lstlisting}
lemma bound_false (k : nat) (t : btree α) :
  bound k t = ff → lookup k t = none := ...

lemma bound_lookup (k : nat) (t : btree α) :
  bound k t → ∃ (v : α), lookup k t = some v := ...
\end{lstlisting}

Both of the proofs were constructed by induction on the tree \lstinline{t}. The lemma \lstinline{bound_false} states that if a key is not bound in a tree, then lookup will not result in any node data being returned. The lemma \lstinline{bound_lookup} states that if a key is bound in a tree, then some data will be returned.
