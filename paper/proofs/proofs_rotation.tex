With rotations, I want to show that a rotation preserves order in a tree, that a rotation does not lose keys, and that rotations preserve balance. This section will informally present some proof constructions based on a right rotation, and any changes that were made to definitions based on the process of constructing these proofs.

\subsection*{Keys}

\subsection*{Order}

\subsection*{Balance}
