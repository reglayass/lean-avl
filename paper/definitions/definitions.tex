AVL trees are a type of binary search trees (BSTs) that are self-balancing - meaning, it must be ordered and balanced after every operation.. Balance and order is assumed and preserved by lookup, insertion and deletion. In Lean, the tree is implemented with an inductive type, and the operations are implemented as functions.
