An AVL tree consists of two basic parts: a \textit{binary search tree} (BST), and rotation algorithms that re-balance the tree when necessary.
This chapter will give definitions of binary search trees and the definitions of rotation algorithms to re-balance the tree.

The online textbook \textit{Software Foundations Volume 3: Verified Functional Algorithms} \cite{bst:upenn} from the University of Pennsylvania was used for some of the basic definitions 
of the tree and operations, and the textbook \textit{Discrete Mathematics with a Computer} \cite{avl:computer} was used for definitions and basic proofs for re-balancing algorithms and deletion.
