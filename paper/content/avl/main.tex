An AVL tree consists of two basic parts: a \textit{binary search tree} (BST), and rotation algorithms that re-balance the tree when necessary.
This chapter will give definitions of binary search trees and the definitions of rotation algorithms to re-balance the tree. \notes{say which textbooks were used extensively and why}.
