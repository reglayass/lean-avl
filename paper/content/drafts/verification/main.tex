This section will go through the verification of binary search trees 
and consequently AVL trees in Lean. First I will give some structural definitions for the tree and its properties, 
and then proceed with an explanation of the various proofs completed. 
The textbook released by the University of Pennsylvania \textit{Verified Functional Algorithms} \cite{bst:upenn}
and \textit{Discrete Mathematics with a Computer} \cite{avl:computer} were used as a reference point for some definitions and basic proof statements.
