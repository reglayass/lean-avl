This chapter goes through the process of formalization of AVL search trees
in Lean, with a description of the inductive types and functions that formalize
the data structure. The full definitions can be found in Appendix \ref{app:defs}.
The textbook \textit{Discrete Mathematics with a Computer} was used extensively to 
help with a functional-programming definition of AVL constructs \cite{avl:computer}.
