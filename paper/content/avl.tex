\subsection{Binary Search Trees}
While Lean does have a definition of a binary search tree, it is limited to the inductive
definition \lstinline{bin_tree}, in which a node only contains its left and right subtree. For a search tree,
it is important that at the very least a tree node has a key and maybe some value. 

% Insertion and lookup are done recursively, traveling through the tree and comparing keys.
